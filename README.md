yayf : Yet, Another Youtube Feed-aggregator
===========================================

This is a small project with go that iterates over the registered youtube
subscription feeds, and notifies you of any new uploads. And returns the full
list of youtube-urls that which can be used to download further.

There are already feed aggregators and another softwares that can do this but
I am doing this for more of a challenge to myself.


TODO
----

- Figure out xml schema of youtube RSS feeds.
- Fetch a single channel feeds.
- Use goroutine to apply over multiple channels at same time.
